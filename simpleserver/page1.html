				<h2>Happy Text</h2>
<p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Every time you practice, you learn more. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.</p>
<p>When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Isn't that fantastic? There are no limits in this world. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
<p>Fluff that up. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart.</p>
