				<h2>Welcome To The Homepage!</h2>
<p>You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Let your imagination be your guide. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?</p>

<p>Every day I learn. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. It is a lot of fun. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. Let your heart be your guide.</p>
